			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>After doing the A3 proposal, I got feedback from my teacher, and I also did a series of testing and usage by multiple users, that allows me to further improve my prototype from the proposal mockups. <br><br>
        The mockup I made was too much like an app rather than a website. Nomally, the website doesn't have a landing page. So I cancelled the landing page and added a new page, contact us<br><br>
        And the interface I designed for the selection of the kittens didn't allow people to read the details well. And I didn't make a navigation bar, which made it hard to find.<br><br>
        I took inspiration from other sites, reworked the structure of my website, and added a lot of detail to each page.
      </p>



		<section id="Design Principle">
			<h2>Design Principle</h2>
      <p>In this section, I will show the various design principles I implemented during this prototype process.</p>
      <h3 id="The structure">The structure</h3>
			<p>The structure of this web-based tutorial went through 2 rough iterations on paper before a final sitemap was created digitally.</p>
      <!-- insert picture -->
      <figure class="img-container">
        <!-- let picture at center -->
	      <center><img src="images/S1.jpg" width="40%"></center>
      	<figcaption><center>There are five stages in this initial sketch iteration. The introduction of adopting a cat is divided into the existing problems of wild cats and how to choose a cat that suits you. There seemed to be some confusion, so I streamlined it.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/S2.jpg" width="40%"></center>
      	<figcaption><center>In the second iteration, I combined the previous question. I put together the introduction of the cat and the choice of the cat that suits me, which makes it easier for people to choose. Although not the final version, this iteration is helpful for the preliminary sketches of the site layout.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>Site map</h4>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/S3.png" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>After two iterations, this is my final site map. I think this can make the adoption of feral cats streamlined and clear, making it easy for people of different ages and purposes.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3 id="Mood boards and visual exploration">Mood boards and visual exploration</h3>
        <p>The page I want to show to users is warm. Because this is a caring activity. I went through 2 iterations about color and finally decided the style of the website.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="images/M6.png" width="20%">
      	<figcaption>This color is too lively and not warm enough</figcaption>
        </figure></li>
				<li><img src="images/M7.png" width="20%">
      	<figcaption>This color is a little dull</figcaption>
        </figure></li>
				<li><img src="images/M8.jpg" width="40%">
      	<figcaption>The color of this color system is very warm. Very suitable for adopting a cat, cute and caring</figcaption>
        </figure></li>
			</ul>
      <h4>pink is the best!</h4>
      <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/M1.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/M2.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/M3.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/M4.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/M5.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Moving onto the layout design, the first iteration was that of sketches for the landing page. A strong landing page is important to hold on to users, set a theme and establish a clear goal and route toward.</p>
      <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch2.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>This is the first sketch. Many websites have such a design. Putting the picture on top gives a preconceived feeling. But I think the space is not well used, and the experience for mobile phone users is not very good.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch3.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>This is the second sketch. I put the photo on the left and the content on the right. But I think that there is too much white space, resulting in too much white space overall, the space is not well used and it is not eye-catching.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch1.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>Using the last two iterations, I designed this sketch. Put the cat's picture on the right and the text on the left. Large pictures can catch people's attention very well and give people a preconceived feeling. All of a sudden, people knew that this is a website about cats, and the text on the left is also reasonably placed.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Choosing the cat that suits you is a very important thing. So I dedicated a page to introduce the types of feral cats I own. Photos are a good way to convey the image of a cat. So I took photos of each cat.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch5.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>The first sketch I designed was an introduction drawing drawn horizontally. This is very similar to the exhibition. I originally liked it, but considering the mobile users, I made the second iteration.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch6.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>The second sketch I designed is an introduction drawing drawn vertically. This kind of space utilization is very low, and it is difficult to write detailed descriptions of various types of cats.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch4.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>I finally chose the square introduction. The circle on the top is the photo of the cat, and the type and color of the cat in the box.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The final confirmation address interface is also very important. It includes the catâ€™s information, the address to be delivered, and our contact information. So I also did a few iterations.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch9.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>The first type of sketch is a more classic mode, just fill in the information. I don't think there is much novelty.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch8.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>For the second type, I chose a more special typesetting. But I considered that this is only the final confirmation interface, if it is too fashion, it will make the previous interface appear less important, so I did the third one.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/sketch7.jpg" width="100%">
      	<figcaption><center>The third type of sketch perfectly shows all the information I want to express. And suitable for users of computers and mobile phones.<center></figcaption>
        </figure>
		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Contain wireframes detailing the overall form and structure of your proposed website and mockups showing the visual and aesthetic design of proposed website.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <p>I chose two layout methods for my first landing page, one is to put the image on the top, the other is to put the image on the left of the brand. But considering the layout of mobile phones, I currently think it would be more reasonable to put pictures on top of the text.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W1.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W2.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW1.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>After going through the login page, I created the home page. It introduces the information of wild cats and it is also a problem of picture placement. Because the content is basically easy to understand, there is no confusing place to understand the information. So I designed two iterations to plan my wireframe.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W3.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W4.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW2.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>After passing the homepage, you need to sign the insurance first. Because insurance is very important, every wildcat has its own insurance when it is adopted to ensure their health. The interface should also be concise and easy to understand, so that users can see information intuitively.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W5.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
        <center><img src="images/WW3.png" width="20%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>Choosing a cat that suits you is also very important, so choosing a cat's wireframe should be clear and intuitive. People can directly see the looks and breeds of cats, as well as the breeder's understanding of their personalities. I chose two methods, the feel of a horizontal poster, and the scrolling like a post-it note.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W6.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W7.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW4.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>The final confirmation page is also clear and warm. And left our contact information. The location of the contact information is eye-catching, so people can find it instantly. I also consider the issue of typesetting conversion between computer users and mobile phones and users.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W8.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
