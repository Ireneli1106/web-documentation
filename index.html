		<section id="Reflection on Proposal">
			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>After doing the A3 proposal, I got feedback from my teacher, and I also did a series of testing and usage by multiple users, that allows me to further improve my prototype from the proposal mockups. <br><br>
        The mockup I made was too much like an app rather than a website. Nomally, the website doesn't have a landing page. So I cancelled the landing page and added a new page, contact us<br><br>
        And the interface I designed for the selection of the kittens didn't allow people to read the details well. And I didn't make a navigation bar, which made it hard to find.<br><br>
        I took inspiration from other sites, reworked the structure of my website, and added a lot of detail to each page.
      </p>
       



		<section id="The structure">
			<h2>The structure</h2>
			<p>The following is an iteration of my overall structure. The structure I envisioned in my proposal is a home page that links to four other pages, but there is no connection between the four pages, making it difficult for users to read the whole page.<br><br>
So I've changed the whole structure to reflect my final home page, with Home, about us, inventory, and contact us in the top navigation bar, and Adopt your cat in the middle of the page. This links all of the pages together.</p>

        </figure>



        <h3 id="Home page">Home page</h3>
        <p>I changed my home page template so that it no longer looks like a landing page. Home page shows the overall structure of the interface in detail, and I designed the navigation bar to connect to other pages. <br><br>
          On the right side, I made a picture of a cat to let people know that this is a website about cats when they open it. <br><br>
          On the left side of the interface, I wrote "Adoption instead of purchase". To hope everyone adopt the right cats – never buy them from a breeder or pet shop to solve Australia’s Feral Cat Problem.</p>

        </figure>
	<h3 id="About us">About us</h3>
			<p>The next two images are iterations of my information page. The main purpose of "about us" is to inform people about the purpose of my page and to call attention to the issue. In my proposal, I put a paragraph on the left side of the interface, and the same picture of the cat on the right. I didn't think this layout was a good use of space.<br><br>
So on my web page, I put an authoritative article and interspersed some images with the text so that it looks neat and convincing. This is my about us page.</p>

        </figure>
 <h3 id="Inventory">Inventory</h3>
        <p>The following two pictures are for people to choose an iteration of the cat species. I call it an inventory because it's information about the cats in the Australian shelter where people can select cats of different ages, genders, and species.<br><br>
Initially my proposal was three in a horizontal row, but I found that this information didn't show up well. I then kept the pictures of the cats and changed them to vertical rows. People can see the different cats by moving the mouse around. Also next to each cat there is a "get me" button, which can be pressed to go to the confirm page.</p>

 <h3 id="Adopt your cat">Adopt your cat</h3>
        <p>The confirmation page is the most important one, at first my confirmation page had a logical flaw in that I didn't fill in my address and it came up with a final confirmation. This is an issue that must be changed.<br><br>
So iteratively, I made my final web confirmation page. By clicking on the "adopt your cat" button on the home page, the user enters the interface with adoption instructions. Finally, click the "submit" button, and a box will pop up to show that the adoption is successful!</p>

<h3 id="contact us">contact us</h3>
        <p>After iterating, I made a separate page for contacting PETA. Since the contact information in the proposal is too hidden, I set up a button in the upper right corner of the home page that clicked "contact us" to bring up a page with information about PETA.<br><br>
Also, on the bottom navigation page of every page (excluding the contact us page), I have placed PETA's contact information, including a place to write directly to PETA.</p>

	<section id="Design Principle">
			<h2>Design Principle</h2>
      <p>In this section, I will show the various design principles I implemented during this prototype process.</p>
      <h3 id="Color">Color</h3>
        <p>Initially I wanted to design my web page in pink and green, which looks very nice and cozy. But considering that this is an offshoot of the PETA website, I changed the colors to something that basically fits it. The blue color also fits this charity project, and I also added pink to show that this is a caring project.</p>

        <p>Making buttons is also an interesting aspect of this web page. I chose the size and color carefully.</p>
