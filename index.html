			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>After doing the A3 proposal, I got feedback from my teacher, and I also did a series of testing and usage by multiple users, that allows me to further improve my prototype from the proposal mockups. <br><br>
        The mockup I made was too much like an app rather than a website. Nomally, the website doesn't have a landing page. So I cancelled the landing page and added a new page, contact us<br><br>
        And the interface I designed for the selection of the kittens didn't allow people to read the details well. And I didn't make a navigation bar, which made it hard to find.<br><br>
        I took inspiration from other sites, reworked the structure of my website, and added a lot of detail to each page.
      </p>
       



		<section id="The structure">
			<h2>The structure</h2>
			<p>The following is an iteration of my overall structure. The structure I envisioned in my proposal is a home page that links to four other pages, but there is no connection between the four pages, making it difficult for users to read the whole page.<br><br>
So I've changed the whole structure to reflect my final home page, with Home, about us, inventory, and contact us in the top navigation bar, and Adopt your cat in the middle of the page. This links all of the pages together.</p>

        </figure>



        <h3 id="Home page">Home page</h3>
        <p>I changed my home page template so that it no longer looks like a landing page. Home page shows the overall structure of the interface in detail, and I designed the navigation bar to connect to other pages. <br><br>
          On the right side, I made a picture of a cat to let people know that this is a website about cats when they open it. <br><br>
          On the left side of the interface, I wrote "Adoption instead of purchase". To hope everyone adopt the right cats – never buy them from a breeder or pet shop to solve Australia’s Feral Cat Problem.</p>

	<h3 id="About us">About us</h3>
			<p>The next two images are iterations of my information page. The main purpose of "about us" is to inform people about the purpose of my page and to call attention to the issue. In my proposal, I put a paragraph on the left side of the interface, and the same picture of the cat on the right. I didn't think this layout was a good use of space.<br><br>
So on my web page, I put an authoritative article and interspersed some images with the text so that it looks neat and convincing. This is my about us page.</p>

        </figure>
 <h3 id="Inventory">Inventory</h3>
        <p>The following two pictures are for people to choose an iteration of the cat species. I call it an inventory because it's information about the cats in the Australian shelter where people can select cats of different ages, genders, and species.<br><br>
Initially my proposal was three in a horizontal row, but I found that this information didn't show up well. I then kept the pictures of the cats and changed them to vertical rows. People can see the different cats by moving the mouse around. Also next to each cat there is a "get me" button, which can be pressed to go to the confirm page.</p>

 <h3 id="Adopt your cat">Adopt your cat</h3>
        <p>The confirmation page is the most important one, at first my confirmation page had a logical flaw in that I didn't fill in my address and it came up with a final confirmation. This is an issue that must be changed.<br><br>
So iteratively, I made my final web confirmation page. By clicking on the "adopt your cat" button on the home page, the user enters the interface with adoption instructions. Finally, click the "submit" button, and a box will pop up to show that the adoption is successful!</p>

	<section id="Design Principle">
			<h2>Design Principle</h2>
      <p>In this section, I will show the various design principles I implemented during this prototype process.</p>



			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <p>I chose two layout methods for my first landing page, one is to put the image on the top, the other is to put the image on the left of the brand. But considering the layout of mobile phones, I currently think it would be more reasonable to put pictures on top of the text.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W1.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W2.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW1.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>After going through the login page, I created the home page. It introduces the information of wild cats and it is also a problem of picture placement. Because the content is basically easy to understand, there is no confusing place to understand the information. So I designed two iterations to plan my wireframe.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W3.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W4.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW2.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>After passing the homepage, you need to sign the insurance first. Because insurance is very important, every wildcat has its own insurance when it is adopted to ensure their health. The interface should also be concise and easy to understand, so that users can see information intuitively.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W5.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
        <center><img src="images/WW3.png" width="20%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>Choosing a cat that suits you is also very important, so choosing a cat's wireframe should be clear and intuitive. People can directly see the looks and breeds of cats, as well as the breeder's understanding of their personalities. I chose two methods, the feel of a horizontal poster, and the scrolling like a post-it note.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W6.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W7.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
        <center><img src="images/WW4.png" width="40%"></center>
        </figure>
        <p>The final confirmation page is also clear and warm. And left our contact information. The location of the contact information is eye-catching, so people can find it instantly. I also consider the issue of typesetting conversion between computer users and mobile phones and users.</p>
        <figure class="img-container">
	      <img src="images/W8.png" width="100%">
        </figure>
